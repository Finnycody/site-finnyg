          This icon is a 16 by 16 pixal rockstar games logo that I coded using
          Hexidecimal. Each pixle is coded in bits of 12, four bits for each
          color; Red, green, and blue, which means that the level of each color
          (RGB) would be coded using one hex character. One hex diget being
          coded by 4 binary digets.

        <p>
          This drawing app that I coded using snap, allows users to freely draw
          with the cursor as well as choose their own RGB settings using
          sliders. You are also able to draw polygons using the polygon button,
          which asks you how many sides you want the polygon to have and also
          where you want the polygon to be drawn. There will be more features
          added to the app in the future, however as of now, we are limited to
          free drawing and the polygon generator/button.

          This is a Flowchart that represents the potential way a coder could
          code guessing game program where the user has to guess a number.
          Flowcharts are ways for coders to visualize a program and check if
          everything works, both logically and functionally, and makes it easy
          for coders to turn that chart into an actual coding language later on.

          This is a picture of the full outcome of me and my partner's weather
          app and final project. We coded this using python and it was part of
          our AP create project for AP computer science. You may visit the
          actual app and the code by clicking on the link above, and even though
          you won't be able to edit it, one may still use the ideas from my code
          in projects of their own. This app allows users to either find the
          average temperature in a month or even the average temperature of a
          specific day.

          This is a project that my partner and a did at the end of the year. It
          was my first time really messing with something like that and I plan
          on doing so in my future more as well. The language we used to code
          the each light was Python, a language that we had already learned in
          the beginning of the year, making it easier for us to be able to code
          this. This project was cool because we got to see our code in physical
          form.
